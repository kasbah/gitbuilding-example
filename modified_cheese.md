# Make a (slightly different) cheese board

Clearly no lunch is completely snazzy without a cheese board. A cheese board is something you curate from the local selection available but this is an example which I think works well

{{BOM}}

## Method:

A simple cheeseboard should generally contain at lease one soft cheese, one hard cheese, and a blue cheese. William suggests putting a hefty chunk of [Caerphilly]{Qty: 1 hefty chunk}, a medium sized wedge of [Bath soft chese](https://parkfarm.co.uk/shop/){Qty: 1 wedge}, and a reasonable slice of [Shropshire Blue]{Qty: 1 slice}. Cut each cheese to size with a [sharp knife]{Qty: 1}, before placing in a [Tupperware tub][Tupperware tubs]{Qty: 1}.
