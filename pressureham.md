# Pressure cook some ham

{{BOM}}

## Method:

Place a nice big [ham joint](ham.md){Qty: 1} into the [Pressure cooker]{Qty: 1}. Add 500ml of [cheap cider]{Qty: 500ml} and pressure cook for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Once finished place the ham to cool on a [Carving board]{Qty: 1}. You can save the liquid to make soup.

After the [cooked ham]{output, qty:20 slices} has cooled down cut it into about 20 slices for sandwiches using a [carving knife]{Qty: 1, cat: tool, note:"(A larding knife works really well if the ham is still hot.)"}.
