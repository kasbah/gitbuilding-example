# A pretty snazzy lunch

This is a simple example of how to use Git-Building. Rather than an open hardware project, this documents "building" a lunch which is, *I feel*, pretty snazzy.

There are two variations on the lunch. The [original lunch](original_lunch.md), and a version with a [modified cheese board](modified_lunch.md) as requested by William.
